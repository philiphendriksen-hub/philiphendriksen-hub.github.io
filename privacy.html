Privacy Policy for Overinflated
Effective Date: 10th of February, 2026

Philip Aerbo Hendriksen ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Overinflated mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

1. Information Collection and Use
We do not require you to create an account or provide a name or email address to play our game. However, we use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

2. Third-Party Services (Advertising)
To provide the game for free, we display advertisements via Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and use data such as:

Advertising IDs (e.g., Apple's IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID).

Cookies and similar tracking technologies.

Device Information (Model, OS version, IP address).

This data is used by Google to serve personalized ads or measure ad performance. You can review Google’s Privacy Policy here: https://policies.google.com/privacy

3. Analytics
We may use basic analytics to understand how many people are playing and where the game crashes. This data is anonymous and does not include personal information.

4. Children’s Privacy
Our Service is intended for a general audience. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and modern 2026 Age-Assurance laws, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or under 18 in specific jurisdictions). If you are a parent and aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.

5. Your Data Rights (GDPR / CCPA)
Depending on your location, you have the right to:

Opt-out of personalized advertising through your device settings (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Interest-Based Ads" on Android).

Request Deletion of any data collected (though since we do not have accounts, we usually do not store data linked to your identity).

6. Updates to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
